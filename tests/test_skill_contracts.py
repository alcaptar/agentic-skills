"""Contract tests between the program and the documentation it is read against.

`make check` covers the Python scripts, but the skills and the judge's rubric are markdown, and
every contract they share with the program that parses or builds them -- or with each other -- is
currently stated twice. Two copies drift the moment only one is edited, and nothing fails when
they do: the runner keeps emitting a marker the parser no longer knows, or one half of a
deliberately duplicated policy gets "fixed" on its own.

Each test here extracts a vocabulary from one surface and compares it against the other, rather
than asserting that a given sentence is present. Rewording that keeps both sides in step passes;
changing one side alone fails. That is the only drift these tests exist to catch.

Two other kinds of contract used to live in this file and do not any more:
`test_domain_vocabulary_contracts.py` holds the two that compare two vocabularies of the program's
own domain with no document in between, and `test_pipeline_invariants.py` holds the six that scan
the tree instead of comparing two copies of the same prose.
