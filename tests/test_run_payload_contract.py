"""The state block does not lose a field between `Run` and `RunPayload`.

`Run` and `RunPayload` each declare the same list of fields three times: the dataclass, the
keywords `from_domain` writes, and the keywords `to_domain` reads back. Every field carries a
default on both sides, so forgetting one in any of those three copies compiles, passes `mypy` and
passes the suite -- the field is simply never persisted and quietly returns to its default on
every resumption. It already happened with `resolved_a_conflict`, which lived only in memory and
sent a dead invocation's merge back to the implementer.

`RunPayload` is the only place that serializes a `Run` -- `TransitionPayload`,
`TransitionRequestPayload` and `SubissueBody` compose it, they do not re-serialize -- so a contract
over this one pair covers every place the state block is written or read.

The one declared asymmetry is `spend_before_reopening`: a key `RunPayload` still declares with no
field in `Run`, kept on purpose as read-compatibility for state blocks a slice already wrote before
that field was retired from the domain (`docs/design-notes.md`, "El gasto que se consulta deja de
depender del `Run` persistido"). It is named here as an exception, not silently excluded, so the
day it is retired this contract goes red instead of staying quiet about the widening.
