"""Invariants against the tree itself, not two copies of the same prose.

Two of the tests here scan the repo instead of comparing a script to a skill: that no call to an
external process is launched without a cap, and that every repo path cited in the docs still
exists. `CLAUDE.md` names the
cap on every external call one of the principles the pipeline does not break, and
`docs/conventions/como-se-escribe.md` cites this file as the contract of cited paths. The fourth
test pins what counts as "launching a process" for the cap check, so a scan that only knows
`subprocess.run` cannot pass silently as the whole rule. The fifth scans `conduct_slice.py` for the
same reason: it pins that every call which writes with the harness discards and retries a
`MeasuredCallError`, instead of trusting prose to keep a fourth such call from being added bare.
The sixth pins the fifth's own mechanism: a `self._x.y(...)` the scan has never seen counts as
harness-writing by default, so a step added later on a brand new port turns the suite red instead
of passing by omission the way naming only the three known calls would have.

The seventh scans every module of the program for a durable store composing its own path instead
of asking `DurableLedger` for one: a call to `ClaudeConfig.root()`, a `*.jsonl` literal, or the
segments `log`/`trace` cited next to `slice-runner` in the same path expression. It is not a list of
the stores that exist today -a well-formed new one that only names `DurableLedger` never trips it-,
which is what the eighth, its meta-test, proves against synthetic source: without it, a scan that
finds nothing and one that is broken read the same.

The ninth scans every module that builds a `DurableLedger` for the vocabulary of a harness turn
(`HarnessTurn`, `TurnLog`, `TurnPayload`): a turn's number, tool and target are what
`tool_use_log.py` already writes when a call ends, so a store that names that vocabulary would be
writing the same row twice. It is not a list of stores either, and the tenth, its meta-test, proves
against synthetic source that a ledger naming that vocabulary trips it and a well-formed one does
not.

The eleventh scans every class inheriting `LedgerRow`, `ReadableLedgerRow` or `StampedRow` for a
coordinate -`ts`, `repo`, `issue`, `slice_id`- declared again instead of taken from `StampedRow`,
the single base that now carries the four. It names what MAY redeclare a field, not what may not,
so the twelfth, its meta-test, proves a class the scan has never seen still turns red by default.
The thirteenth scans for the canonical slice text composed by hand -peeling `"slice-"` off a
string, or `:02d`-formatting an ordinal- anywhere outside `CanonicalSliceId`, the one place that
format is allowed to exist, and the fourteenth is its meta-test.

The fifteenth scans every module of the program for `AliasChoices`, the shape that let a payload
reread a key from an earlier generation of the log next to the one it writes today. With the
reader and the writer collapsed into the same model, nothing left has a reason to carry it: a
payload that uses it again is tolerating a shape this program no longer writes, which is the same
regression `MetricsLedgerRowPayload` used to be. It is not a list of today's offenders -a
well-formed payload that never imports `AliasChoices` never trips it-, which is what the
sixteenth, its meta-test, proves against synthetic source.
